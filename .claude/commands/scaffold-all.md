# Scaffold Complete Project Foundation

Generate all essential documents for a new project in the correct order.

## Project Setup Wizard

I'll create a complete project foundation in `projects/$1/`

**Project Name:** $1 (creates: projects/$1/)
**Project Type:** $2 (web app, API, library, CLI tool, etc.)
   - Primary language/framework
   - Target users

2. **Scale & constraints:**
   - Expected load/users
   - Performance requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Budget constraints

## Documents I'll Generate

In the optimal order:

1. **PRD.md** - Product requirements and success criteria
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design and technical approach
3. **RULES.md** - Non-negotiable constraints and standards
4. **TASKS.md** - Work breakdown with parallel streams
5. **BEST-PRACTICES.md** - Coding standards for your stack
6. **PATTERNS.md** - Approved design patterns
7. **ANTI-PATTERNS.md** - What to avoid
8. **CLAUDE.md** - AI agent work contract
9. **GIT-STRATEGY.md** - Version control workflow
10. **EVALS_AND_TESTING.md** - Testing and evaluation strategy

## Project-Specific Tools

Based on project type ($2), I'll also create:

### For Web/API Projects
- **Agents**: frontend-developer, api-designer, database-architect
- **Commands**: /create-component, /add-api-endpoint, /optimize-bundle
- **Output Style**: Code generation preferences and standards

### For Writing Projects  
- **Agents**: editor, outline-developer, consistency-checker
- **Commands**: /add-chapter, /check-consistency, /word-count
- **Output Style**: Writing tone, style, and formatting preferences

### For Research Projects
- **Agents**: hypothesis-tester, literature-reviewer, data-validator
- **Commands**: /add-hypothesis, /analyze-data, /generate-figures
- **Output Style**: Academic writing and analysis preferences

## Cross-Document Validation

After generation, I'll:
- Check for conflicts between documents
- Ensure consistent terminology
- Verify all requirements have tasks
- Confirm patterns align with architecture
- Validate that rules are enforceable

## Next Steps

Once generated, I'll provide:
- Quick start guide for your team
- Suggested first sprint tasks
- Recommended team structure
- Timeline estimates

Ready to scaffold your complete project foundation!
