# Scaffold Architecture Document

Generate a comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md based on your technology stack.

## Stack Information

Tell me about your technology choices:
- Language and runtime
- Framework(s)
- Database(s)
- Infrastructure (cloud, on-prem)
- Key integrations

## Architecture Generation

Based on @guides/ARCHITECTURE.md template, I'll create:

1. **System Overview** - High-level diagram and components
2. **Constraints & Quality Goals** - Performance, reliability, security targets
3. **Domain Model** - Core entities and relationships
4. **Component Responsibilities** - What each part does
5. **Data Flow** - Key user journeys
6. **External Integrations** - APIs and third-party services
7. **Storage & Schema** - Database design and evolution
8. **Security Model** - Authentication, authorization, data protection
9. **Reliability & Operations** - SLOs, monitoring, runbooks
10. **Performance & Capacity** - Caching, scaling, optimization
11. **Build & Deploy** - CI/CD pipeline
12. **API Contracts** - Interface definitions

## Stack-Specific Patterns

For $ARGUMENTS stack, I'll include:
- Recommended folder structure
- Best practices for the framework
- Common patterns for this tech stack
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security considerations

The architecture will be production-ready and scalable.
