#### For Technical Documentation
```
1. Overview
   - Purpose
   - Audience
   - Prerequisites

2. Getting Started

```

### Phase 3: Detail Development

For each section, provide:
- Key points (3-5 per section)
- Supporting evidence/examples
- Transitions to next section
- Word count targets
- Research needs

## Outline Evaluation Criteria

## Key Learning/Plot Points
1. [Main point/event]
2. [Supporting point/event]
3. [Concluding point/event]

## Opening

```

## Progressive Refinement

### Version 1: High-Level

- Chapter titles
- Basic flow

### Version 2: Detailed
- Section breakdowns
- Key points per section
- Transitions mapped

### Version 3: Comprehensive

2. Problem analysis
3. Solution options
4. Solution implementation
5. Results/validation

### Chronological
1. Beginning/origins
2. Development/growth
3. Challenges/conflicts
4. Resolution/current state
5. Future/implications

### Compare-Contrast
1. Introduction to subjects
2. Similarities
3. Differences
4. Evaluation
5. Recommendation

### Cause-Effect
1. Initial conditions
2. Triggering events
3. Immediate effects
4. Long-term impacts
5. Lessons learned

Remember: A great outline is the skeleton that supports the entire body of work. Make it strong, logical, and complete.
